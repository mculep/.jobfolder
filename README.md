##### Time Frame: Two weeks

## Summary:

Jobfolder is an app that helps users that are about to embark on a job hunt. This app will keep them organized with their current resumes, cover letters, keep track of the job they've applied to, and create a place to hold all their previous interview questions. Job hunting is a job in itself, so being organized and having everything in one place will help users make their job hunt less stressful.

### **Quantitative** research:

---

Although research is not part of the project requirement, we decided to conduct a short online survey to decide what types of features to implement into this Resume app idea. This helped us gain some insights from 32 participants and guided us on how to go forward with the design phase.
